# Compiler

Doesn't do much yet, it was just a practice project. Might expand to it in the future if I feel like it.

## Supported operations

For now it only does **three** mathematical operations:

* Addition (+)
* Substraction (-)
* Multiplication (*)

Now it does **logical** operations as well!

* or
* xor
* and
* not (!)

## Compile from a file

```C
Compile("path/to/file");
```

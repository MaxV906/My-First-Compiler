# Compiler

Doesn't much yet, it was just a practice project. Might expand to it in the future if I feel like it.

## Supported operations

For now it only does **three** mathematical operations:

* Addition (+)
* Substraction (-)
* Multiplication (*)

It also has a token type for brackets, it recognizes them but I am not handling them in any way at the moment. It may cause some **bugs** if used.
